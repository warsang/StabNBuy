## File-upload-in-Node
===================

This is a POC which won a Microsoft and CDiscount hackathon about two years ago. I made the nodejs server as well as the chrome extension with the help of a girl whom I don't remember the name...(I really don't mean to steal any credit there :/)

(Here)[https://youtu.be/SjCn1HAbfXo] is what the app does (or is supposed to do, remember it's only a POC).

To import the chromium extension just go in Settings>Extensions>Developer mode>Load unpacked extension and select the extension file

Run the server with the usual:
```node Server.js``` 
Don't forget to install npm dependencies though I'm uploading them  to the repo.

Visit ```localhost:3000``` to test the app (should print ok in prompt).
